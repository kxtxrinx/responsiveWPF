# responsiveWPF
A straightforward application designed to showcase responsive design principles in C# using WPF. The user interface dynamically adjusts its structure when the window size falls below 500px, demonstrating the power of responsiveness. The data is bound to the interface, ensuring its persistence even during structural changes :)
